# Comprehensive Contract Management System

This document describes the enhanced contract management system that allows organizations to fully manage their inter-organization contracts with comprehensive editing, deletion, version control, and approval workflows.

## üöÄ New Features

### 1. **Contract Name & Description Management**
- **Custom Contract Names**: Set meaningful names for contracts instead of auto-generated IDs
- **Contract Descriptions**: Add detailed descriptions explaining the purpose and scope
- **Contract Types**: Choose from predefined contract types (data_sharing, file_sharing, service_integration, compliance_reporting)

### 2. **Contract Editing with Approval Workflow**
- **Edit Active Contracts**: Modify contract name, description, type, and resources
- **Approval Required**: All changes require approval from the other organization
- **Version Control**: Each edit creates a new version with change tracking
- **Change Summary**: Add messages explaining what was changed and why

### 3. **Contract Deletion with Approval Workflow**
- **Request Deletion**: Initiate deletion requests for active contracts
- **Reason Required**: Must provide a reason for deletion
- **Approval Required**: Other organization must approve the deletion
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of deletion requests and responses

### 4. **Version Control System**
- **Automatic Versioning**: Each contract edit creates a new version
- **Version History**: View all versions of a contract with timestamps
- **Change Tracking**: See what changed between versions
- **Approval Status**: Track approval status for each version

### 5. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
- **Action Tracking**: Log all contract-related actions (create, edit, delete, approve, reject)
- **User Attribution**: Track who performed each action
- **IP Address Logging**: Record IP addresses for security
- **Detailed Information**: Store complete action details for compliance

### 6. **Enhanced UI/UX**
- **Action Buttons**: Edit, Delete, View Versions, View Audit Logs
- **Modal Interfaces**: Clean, intuitive modal dialogs for all actions
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for contract and action status
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## üéØ Frontend Implementation

### New State Management

```javascript
// Contract management state
const [showEditContractModal, setShowEditContractModal] = useState(false);
const [showDeleteContractModal, setShowDeleteContractModal] = useState(false);
const [showContractVersionsModal, setShowContractVersionsModal] = useState(false);
const [showContractAuditModal, setShowContractAuditModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedContract, setSelectedContract] = useState(null);
const [contractVersions, setContractVersions] = useState([]);
const [contractAuditLogs, setContractAuditLogs] = useState([]);
const [contractTypes, setContractTypes] = useState([]);

// Contract edit form state
const [editContractForm, setEditContractForm] = useState({
  contract_name: "",
  contract_description: "",
  contract_type: "data_sharing",
  resources_allowed: [],
  approval_message: ""
});

// Contract deletion form state
const [deleteContractForm, setDeleteContractForm] = useState({
  deletion_reason: "",
  approval_message: ""
});
```

### New Action Buttons

The contracts table now includes comprehensive action buttons:

- **Edit Contract** (üìù): Opens edit modal for active contracts
- **Delete Contract** (üóëÔ∏è): Opens deletion modal for active contracts
- **View Versions** (üìã): Shows version history
- **View Audit Logs** (üìä): Shows audit trail
- **Approve/Reject Actions** (‚úÖ/‚ùå): For pending update/deletion requests

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Contract Update Workflow

1. **User clicks "Edit" button** on an active contract
2. **Edit modal opens** with current contract details
3. **User modifies** contract name, description, type, or resources
4. **User submits** update request with optional message
5. **Backend creates** new version and marks as pending
6. **Other organization receives** notification of update request
7. **Other organization can** approve or reject the update
8. **If approved**, contract is updated with new version
9. **If rejected**, update is cancelled with reason

### Contract Deletion Workflow

1. **User clicks "Delete" button** on an active contract
2. **Delete modal opens** requiring deletion reason
3. **User provides** reason and optional message
4. **User submits** deletion request
5. **Backend marks** contract for deletion (pending)
6. **Other organization receives** notification of deletion request
7. **Other organization can** approve or reject the deletion
8. **If approved**, contract is marked as deleted
9. **If rejected**, deletion is cancelled with reason

## üìä Contract Types

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Backend server running with updated models and endpoints
- Frontend with new contract management components
- Database with new collections for versions and audit logs

### Usage
1. **Navigate to Contracts tab** in Organization Dashboard
2. **View existing contracts** with enhanced action buttons
3. **Click action buttons** to manage contracts:
   - Edit: Modify contract details
   - Delete: Request contract deletion
   - Versions: View version history
   - Audit: View audit logs
4. **Approve/Reject** pending actions from other organizations

## üîß Configuration

### Contract Types
Contract types can be configured in the backend:

```python
contract_types = [
    {
        "type_id": "data_sharing",
        "name": "Data Sharing",
        "description": "Contract for sharing PII and sensitive data",
        "allowed_resources": ["aadhaar", "pan", "account", ...],
        "default_retention": "30 days"
    },
    # Add more types as needed
]
```

### Retention Periods
Available retention periods:
- 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days
- 1 year, 2 years, 5 years

### Audit Logging
Audit logs capture:
- Action type (create, update, delete, approve, reject)
- User ID and organization
- Timestamp and IP address
- Complete action details

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Contract not editable**
   - Ensure contract status is "active"
   - Verify user belongs to contract organization

2. **Approval not working**
   - Check if user belongs to the other organization
   - Verify contract has pending actions

3. **Versions not showing**
   - Ensure contract has been edited at least once
   - Check database for version records

4. **Audit logs empty**
   - Verify audit logging is enabled
   - Check database connection

### Error Messages

- **"Only active contracts can be updated"**: Contract must be in active status
- **"No pending action found"**: No update/deletion request to approve
- **"You can only approve actions for contracts involving your organization"**: User not authorized
- **"Contract name is required"**: Must provide contract name when editing

## üìù Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Bulk Operations**: Edit/delete multiple contracts
- **Template System**: Predefined contract templates
- **Advanced Analytics**: Contract usage and performance metrics
- **Integration APIs**: External system integration
- **Mobile Support**: Mobile-optimized interface

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed contract data
- **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of contracts efficiently
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for contract changes
