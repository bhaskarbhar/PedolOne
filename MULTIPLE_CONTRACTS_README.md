# Multiple Contracts Between Organizations

This document describes the enhanced inter-organization contract system that now supports multiple contracts between two organizations for different purposes and resource types.

## Overview

The system has been upgraded to allow organizations to establish multiple contracts with each other, each serving different purposes:

- **Data Sharing Contracts**: For sharing PII and sensitive data
- **File Sharing Contracts**: For secure document exchange
- **Service Integration Contracts**: For API and service access
- **Compliance Reporting Contracts**: For regulatory compliance

## Key Features

```

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Multiple Contract Types Between Organizations

BankABC and InsuranceABC establish three different contracts:

1. **Data Sharing Contract**: For KYC and identity verification
2. **File Sharing Contract**: For document exchange
3. **Service Integration Contract**: For API access

```python
# Create Data Sharing Contract
data_contract = {
    "target_org_id": "insurance_org_id",
    "contract_name": "Bank-Insurance Data Sharing 2024",
    "contract_type": "data_sharing",
    "resources_allowed": [
        {"resource_name": "aadhaar", "purpose": ["KYC verification"]},
        {"resource_name": "pan", "purpose": ["Identity validation"]}
    ]
}

# Create File Sharing Contract
file_contract = {
    "target_org_id": "insurance_org_id",
    "contract_name": "Bank-Insurance File Sharing",
    "contract_type": "file_sharing",
    "resources_allowed": [
        {"resource_name": "excel_files", "purpose": ["Document sharing"]},
        {"resource_name": "pdf_files", "purpose": ["Compliance reporting"]}
    ]
}

# Create Service Integration Contract
service_contract = {
    "target_org_id": "insurance_org_id",
    "contract_name": "Bank-Insurance API Integration",
    "contract_type": "service_integration",
    "resources_allowed": [
        {"resource_name": "api_access", "purpose": ["API integration"]}
    ]
}
```

### Scenario 2: Data Sharing with Contract Selection

When sharing data, the system automatically selects the appropriate contract:

```python
# Share data - system automatically selects data_sharing contract
share_request = {
    "target_org_id": "insurance_org_id",
    "user_id": 123,
    "resources": ["aadhaar", "pan"],
    "purpose": ["KYC verification"]
}

# Response includes which contract was used
response = {
    "message": "Data shared successfully with InsuranceABC using contract 'Bank-Insurance Data Sharing 2024'",
    "policies_created": 2,
    "contract_used": {
        "contract_id": "data_contract_id",
        "contract_name": "Bank-Insurance Data Sharing 2024",
        "contract_type": "data_sharing"
    }
}
```

### Scenario 3: Contract Statistics and Monitoring

```python
# Get comprehensive contract statistics
stats = {
    "total_contracts": 15,
    "active_contracts": 12,
    "pending_contracts": 2,
    "expired_contracts": 1,
    "partner_organizations": 8,
    "contracts_by_type": {
        "data_sharing": {"total": 8, "active": 7, "pending": 1, "expired": 0},
        "file_sharing": {"total": 4, "active": 3, "pending": 1, "expired": 0},
        "service_integration": {"total": 3, "active": 2, "pending": 0, "expired": 1}
    }
}
```

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Flexibility**

## Migration from Single Contract System

The system maintains backward compatibility with existing single-contract setups:

1. **Existing Contracts**: Continue to work as before
2. **Legacy Support**: Old contract structures are automatically handled
3. **Gradual Migration**: Organizations can gradually adopt multiple contracts
4. **Default Values**: Missing fields are populated with sensible defaults

## Testing

Run the test script to verify multiple contracts functionality:

```bash
python test_multiple_contracts.py
```

This will:
1. Create multiple contract types between organizations
2. Test contract statistics and filtering
3. Verify data sharing with contract selection
4. Demonstrate partner organization management

## Future Enhancements

1. **Contract Templates**: Pre-defined contract templates for common use cases
2. **Contract Negotiation**: Multi-step contract approval workflow
3. **Contract Analytics**: Advanced analytics and reporting
4. **Automated Renewal**: Automatic contract renewal notifications
5. **Contract Comparison**: Side-by-side contract comparison tools
6. **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple contracts simultaneously

## Support

For issues or questions regarding multiple contracts:
1. Check the contract creation logs
2. Verify contract approval status
3. Ensure resources and purposes match contract definitions
4. Test with the provided test script
5. Review contract statistics for insights
